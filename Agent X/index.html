      <p><span class="dropcap">D</span>onald Armstrong,<br>
is a Graphic Designer, Comic Book Colourist, and 3D Artist. HE is currently enrolled in Fanshawe College's "Interactive Media and Design" program and I will be graduating in April, 2017. He have 8+ years of design experience. And is a self taught graphic artist, comic book colourist and creator of STOOPID the card game. He has always had an obsession with art in general. As a child, He was always drawing, building or creating something. However, Like most he was always told by adults “There is no money in art. You should have a normal job, like a mechanic (Cars are another love of his), or learn a trade of some kind.” Although this was difficult to hear, his love of art never left. He have always kept his creativity. He was always drawing and enjoying other art forms. It wasn't until later in life that he realized that if done properly, there was indeed money in art. This is when he started drawing again and started using computers to draw with. Then came graphic design, and then digital colouring. He took it upon himself to learn PhotoShop and other graphic software. It didn't take long to realize that he had a hidden talent to use computers to create art.

In 2010, a tragedy struck his family when their 4 year old daughter was diagnosed with cancer. His world stopped. He gave up my career in the IT Industry and walked his daughter through her cancer treatments. Sophia was a light in his world and she lost her fight in 2011. She is missed everyday. In a rage He gave up art and said he would never create anything again.

It was close to a year later when he chose to honour his daughter and return to art. he purchased another Wacom Cintiq and began the long road to recovery. In the 4 years since his return, He have owned and operated a T-shirt studio, had 3 comic books published, created, designed and printed his own collectible card game called STOOPID The Card Game. Most recently his returned to college and is soon graduate from the “Interactive Media Design Program” through Fanshawe College.<br> 
His goal in the short term is to become a UI/UX artist and 3D modeler for a local game studio.

For the first time in years he felt a sense of hope, and he looks forward to the possibilities of what the future may hold.<BR>
Dedicated to Sophia Armstrong (AKA Child of Light). Your light will always shine brightest in our hearts.</p></div>
